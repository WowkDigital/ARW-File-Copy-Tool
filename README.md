üìÇ ARW File Copy Tool (GUI)
A modern Python desktop application built with **CustomTkinter** for quickly selecting and copying **.ARW** files based on a pasted **.enc** list.

The tool automatically matches files like `n_X.enc` ‚Üí `n_X.ARW` and copies them to a dedicated folder (selected by default).

3.  The app:
    * **Extracts** numbers from patterns like `n_X.enc`
    * **Matches** them with files like `n_X.ARW`
    * **Copies** found files to `[source]/selected` (or another destination if changed)
4.  If some files are missing, the app warns you after completion.
